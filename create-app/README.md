# @comet/create-app

This is a command-line interface to create a new Comet application.
It sets up a project with the necessary configuration and files to get started quickly.

## Usage

```bash
npx @comet/create-app <project-name>
```

### Arguments

The following arguments can be passed to customize the project setup:

- `--help` or `-h`: Display help for the command.

#### Example usage with arguments

Create a new Comet app with the name "my-project" and enable verbose logging:

```bash
npx @comet/create-app my-project -v
```

Create a new Comet app with a different repository and branch:

```bash
npx @comet/create-app my-project -r https://github.com/my-company/comet-starter.git -b next
```

### Commands

The following commands can be used to customize the project setup:

- `remove-site`: Removes the site from the project.

## For developers

### Development

To test the script locally, run the following commands:

1. Start the development process:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash

Testing a close to production usage of the CLI can be done by calling `npm link` in the create-app/ directory. Then `npx @comet/create-app` can be used.
